M.R. Hage, R.D. van Heuven van Staereling,

You receive this email because you successfully completed the
Operating Systems Practical 2008/2009. As standard part of this
course, we provide you with your grades for the individual exercises,
and a number of feedback points.

Exercise 1: 8.00
Exercise 2: 8.25
Exercise 3: 7.25

- Do not redefine constants that are already available in Minix (e.g.
  ULONG_MAX in limits.h) (ex.1)
- A function call in the clock handler is costly (ex.1)
- No need to use locks in the kernel-level part of the code (ex.1)
- profile: unnecessary use of global variables (ex.1)
- Nonstandard identation (ex.1)
- Could have used fsck to verify the input filesystem consistency, no
  need to reimplement it all yourself (ex.2)
- Indirect/double indirect block handling could have been done with one
  recursive function (ex.2)
- Dynamically allocating memory in servers is bad and not needed (ex.3)
- Returning an uninitialized variable in thread_wait() - verbose output
  not checked? (ex.3)
- Documentation: no description of own testing efforts (ex.3)

DISCLAIMER: this feedback is provided purely as a courtesy to you, and
is no ground for appeal. The provided points are of varying weight,
and -due to the way our grading process works- are generally not
representative for your grade. You can make an appointment for a more
elaborate explanation, but please note that we are limited in what we
can give away, as the same course will run next year. We generally
only list negative points.

Regards,

Your course assistants
