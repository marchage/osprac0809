# My experiences doing the Operating Systems Practical
- [x] ~~include cd-rom image~~ github 100mb limit
- [x] copy source here
- [ ] ~~apply patches~~  directories `origsrc` and `src` do not exist. Needs to be run first (and perhaps some other steps).
- [ ] ~~git-submodule or fork original source, perhaps?~~ [initial commit/no interesting history](git@github.com:Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix.git).
- [ ] find the original assignments
- [ ] include book.iso via git lfs?


## Installation
* Install [cd-rom image](http://download.minix3.org/iso/minix-3.1.0-book.iso.bz2) on old hardware or vm
* Mind the network-card driver...!
* Start coding in vi
* Make patch and transfer it to a safe place via ftp
* detailed instruction [here](http://www.minix3.org/doc/A-312.pdf)

## Description
Teams had to provide solutions to 3 assignments of the master course Operating Systems practical(osprac0809) at the VU university of Amsterdam. Our programming team consisted of [teammate](https://github.com/richadr) and I, and we participated during the during the academic year 2008/2009. We received a total grade of 8 out of 10. The starting point was the source from the cdrom at the back of [this book](http://www.minix3.org/doc/). The source in this repository is copied over from [this tag](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix/releases/tag/v3.1.0) in an attempt to apply patches directly on it (failed) and to provide some contect. A fresh install, by using the cd-rom image, is mostlikely more of interest when trying to run any of the answers. Git or svn was not used amoung ~~students~~ by our team in 2008-2009. The course is no longer taught at VU university.
