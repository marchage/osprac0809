# My experiences doing the Operating Systems Practical
- [x] ~~include cd-rom image~~ github 100mb limit
- [x] copy source here
- [ ] ~~apply patches~~  directories `origsrc` and `src` do not exist. Needs to be run first (and perhaps some other steps).
- [ ] ~~git-submodule or fork original source, perhaps?~~ [initial commit/no interesting history](git@github.com:Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix.git).


## Installation
* Install [cd-rom image](http://download.minix3.org/iso/minix-3.1.0-book.iso.bz2) on old hardware or vm
* Mind the network-card driver...!
* Start coding in vi
* Make patch and transfer it to a safe place via ftp
* detailed instruction [here](www.minix3.org/doc/A-312.pdf)

## Description
Our ([teammate](https://github.com/richadr) and I) answers to the then 3 assignments of the master course Operating Systems practical(osprac0809) at the [VU university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrije_Universiteit_Amsterdam) during the academic year 2008/2009. The course is not in current curricula at this university. The received total grade was an 8 (out of 10). The original source had to be the cdrom at the back of [this book](http://www.minix3.org/doc/) and the source here is copied over from [this tag](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix/releases/tag/v3.1.0) on github. Git or svn was not used amoung ~~students~~ by our team in 2008-2009.
