## Description
Our ([teammate](https://github.com/richadr) and I) answers to the then 3 assignments of the master course Operating Systems practical(osprac0809) at the [VU university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrije_Universiteit_Amsterdam) during the academic year 2008/2009. The course is not on current curricula at this university. The received total grade was an 8 (out of 10). The original source had to be the cdrom at the back of [minix3 book](http://www.minix3.org/doc/) and the source here is copied over from [this tag](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix/releases/tag/v3.1.0) of the [minix](http://minix3.org/) operating system on github. Git or svn was not used amoung ~~students~~ by our team in 2008-2009.
