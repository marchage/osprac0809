# Operating Systems practical(osprac0809)
- [ ] ~~apply patches and commit~~  directories `origsrc` and `src` do not exist in source. You need to run it first (and perhaps more).
- [x] copy over source into this repository
- [ ] ~~make a git-submodule/fork/sort-of-package-manage the original minix source, perhaps?~~ [initial commit/no interesting history](git@github.com:Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix.git). [Included shell script](git-rewrite-to-subfolder) cloned from [here](https://gist.github.com/x3ro/6242017) could be interesting.

Our ([teammate](@richadr) and my) answers to the then 3 assignments of the master course Operating Systems practical(osprac0809) at the [VU university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrije_Universiteit_Amsterdam) during the academic year 2008/2009. The received grade was an 8 (out of 10). The original source was the source equal to the cdrom at the back of [minix3 book](http://www.minix3.org/doc/) but here you will find a submoduled tag from the most likely [representation](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix/releases/tag/v3.1.0) of the [minix](http://minix3.org/) operating system on github. Too bad we didn't use a (better) version contole system (than the host operating system's file system). Git or svn was not used amoung ~~students~~ by our team in 2008-2009.
